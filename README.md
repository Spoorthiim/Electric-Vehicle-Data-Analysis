# **Electric Vehicle Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Tableau)**  

## **Project Objective**  
This project provides a **comprehensive analysis** of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends using **Tableau**. The dashboard presents key insights into EV distribution, model preferences, battery range, and state-wise adoption patterns, helping stakeholders understand market trends and consumer behavior.  

## **Dataset Used**  
- **Electric Vehicle Registration Data**  

## **Key Questions (KPIs)**  
1. **Total EVs on the road** – Breakdown of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).  
2. **EV Adoption Over Time** – Vehicles registered by model year.  
3. **State-wise EV Distribution** – Identifying regions with the highest EV adoption.  
4. **Top EV Manufacturers** – Leading brands contributing to EV growth.  
5. **CAFV Eligibility** – Percentage of vehicles eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives.  
6. **Average Electric Range** – Understanding battery efficiency trends.  
7. **Most Popular EV Models** – Identifying top-selling electric vehicle models.  

## **Dashboard Insights**  
- **Total Vehicles:** **1,50,422**  
- **BEV Vehicles:** **1,16,750** (~77.61%)  
- **PHEV Vehicles:** **33,672** (~22.39%)  
- **Average Electric Range:** **67.83 miles**  
- **Peak EV Adoption Years:** **2022 (37.08K vehicles) & 2021 (27.80K vehicles)**  
- **Top EV Manufacturer:** **Tesla (68,943 vehicles, ~45.83%)**  
- **CAFV Eligibility:** **41.81% of vehicles qualify**  
- **Most Popular EV Model:** **Tesla Model (28,502 vehicles, ~18.95%)**
